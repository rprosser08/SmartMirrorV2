# SmartMirrorV2
GUI for a Smart Mirror

## Project Description
This code is for the GUI component for a smart mirror. It includes the current time and date, the current weather, news headlines with abstracts.

## Instructions
Until the script is created, you will need to download the necessary dependencies. You will also need to create free accounts with [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/),
and [The New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com). You will put these API keys into a .env file located in the root folder. The WeatherAPI API key will need to be called "WEATHER_API_KEY" and the New York Times API key will need to be called "NYT_API_KEY". Finally you will run the "mainframe.py" file to launch the smart mirror.

## TODO
